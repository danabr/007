      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          007 is a distributed software agent system. Software agents traverse agent servers
          in order to perform some task. This project aims at providing the basic infrastructure
          for such a system, as well as an implementation to show off the system's capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example agents organizes and plays Rock/Paper/Scissors tournaments. A full
          description of the system can be found in the dedicated section below.
        </p>

        <h2>Where to find it</h2>
        <p>
          The Netbeans project, with source, documentation and runnables, is downloadable from 
          <a href="https://github.com/danabr/007">Github</a> (see the Downloads button).<br/>
          The git repository itself contains only source code, as well as this file.
        </p>

        <h2>How to run</h2>
        <p>
          You have multiple options to run servers or clients.
          No matter which option you choose, the following example
          commands assume that the project directory is your 
          current working directory.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Starting a single server</h3>
          <p>
            You start a single server by invoking: <br/>
            <code>java -cp build\classes agent.server.BasicServer &lt;serverport&gt; [&lt;multicast ip&gt; &lt;multicast port&gt;]</code><br/>
            The multicast arguments are optional.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Starting multiple servers at once</h3>
          <p>
            You may start multiple servers at once, all attached to the same multicast ip and port,
            by invoking the following command: <br/>
            <code>java -cp build\classes rps.ServerRunner &lt;numservers&gt; [&lt;multicast ip&gt; &lt;multicast port&gt;]</code>
            <br/>
            The servers will start consecutively on port 10000, 10001, etc.
            Note that the multicast arguments are optional.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Starting a client</h3>
          <p>
            You start a single client by invoking the command:<br/>
            <code>java -cp build\classes rps.RPSClient &lt;clientport&gt; [&lt;multicast ip&gt; &lt;multicast port&gt;]</code>
            <br/>The multicast arguments are optional.

        <h2>Technologies and platforms</h2>
        <p>
            The project was developed and tested using Netbeans on a Dell XPS M1330 machine
            running Windows 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only technologies part of Java SE 6 was used.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Implementation details</h2>
        <p>
          This section outlines the framework part of the system.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Basic structure</h3>
          <img src="framework.png" /><br/>
          <em>The agent framework's package structure</em>
          <p>
            All framework related classes are placed under the <em>agent</em> package and 
            its subpackages. These packages contain both interfaces, abstract classes handling
            the common cases and full implementations that are generally useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The normal start phase for implementing an agent would be to use BasicServer as
            the server, extend BasicClient to create a client, and than extend AbstractAgent
            in order to implement the agent.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Server related parts</h3>
          <p>
            The most general part of the server related parts is the
            <em>AgentServer</em> interface. It contains the minimal set
            of operations an agent server must provide. These include support for
            agent migration, footprint support, neighbour discovery support, and 
            support for getting a list of residing agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>AbstractServer</em> class implements the common parts of an
            abstract server, such as agent migration, storing of footprints and
            updating the list of residing agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>server.BasicServer</em> class is a full server implementation,
            capable of discovering neighbouring servers. It is basic in the
            sense that it does not contain support for anything but invoking
            agents.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Client related parts</h3>
          <p>
            The only client related class is the <em>client.BasicClient</em> class.
            It is an abstract class that simplifies implementing simple clients
            by taking care of server disovery and service point selection,
            as well as sending and receiving agents. The real client implementation
            is notified about different events through callbacks.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Agent related parts</h3>
          <p>
            The most important agent related part is the <em>Agent</em> interface.
            It defines the minimal set of capabilities an agent must have, which
            is to provide information about it's home location as well as a callback
            that will be called when the agent has been migrated to a new server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>AbstractAgent</em> class encapsulates common agent functionality,
            such as maintaining a list of visited servers, maintaining information of
            the agent's home, and supporting agent migration.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>Messaging agents</h4>
            <p>
              Messaging agents are agents capable of sending/receiving messages to/from other agents.
              Messaging agents are useful when agents need to communicate in a safe way.
              Support for messaging agents is provided through two classes: the abstract class
              <em>MessagingAgent</em> with methods for posting and waiting for messages,
              and the class <em>Message</em> that encapsulates message information. Both classes
              are found in the <em>messaging</em> subpackage.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Stateful agents</h4>
            <p>
              The framework contains support for stateful agents through the
              <em>State&lt;T&gt;</em> and <em>StateMatchine&lt;T&gt;</em> classes
              in the <em>states</em> subpackage.
              The reason to include such classes is that that states are often a natural
              way to model agent behaviour.
            </p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Server discovery and discovery related classes</h3>
          <p>
            <em>BasicServer</em> and <em>BasicClient</em> both make use of the
            classes under the <em>agent.discovery</em> package. This package contains
            classes for performing multicast server discovery of neighbour agent servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multicast was chosen for simplicity. However, it is limited as it can not be
            used on wireless networks. A flooding based discovery mechanism would have
            handled these issues, but is also more complicated to implement.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>The discovery protocol</h4>
            <p>
                The protocol used for server discovery is very simple.
                Clients (in the broader sense of the word) send the string
                "DISVOVER" to a multicast group. It then listens for "REPLY"
                messages, using the information in the UDP package to extract
                server address and port number.
            </p>
            <p>
              A server runs a discovery server, responsible for sending a "REPLY"
              message to any client sending a "DISOVER" message. The server replies
              using the port on which it is willing to receive agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same mechanism is used for both server-server discovery and client-server
              discovery. A richer protocol might be of interest for agents looking for servers
              with certain capabilities, but no such protocol is provided at the framework level.

        <h2>Rock/Paper/Scissors agents</h2>
        <p>
          Rock/Paper/Scissors (RPS) agents try to arrange RPS tournaments.
          They travel around looking for other agents to join their tournament,
          or joins someone else's tournament if it is bigger. Eventually, they
          return home and relate about their journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          RPS agents are stateful, message passing agents, taking advantage of all
          the capabilities of <em>BasicServer</em>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>States</h3>
          <img src="states.png"/>
          <br/><em>RPS state diagram</em>
          <p>
            The above pictures summarizes the possible state transitions of an
            agent playing the Rock/Paper/Scissors game. All agents start with a
            state of <em>InitialState</em>. The following sections elaborates each state.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>General states</h4>
            <p>
              The states in this section applies to both tournament participants
              and tournament masters.
            </p>
            <section>
              <h5>MoveHome state</h5>
              <p>
                This state migrates the agent to its home.
              </p>
            </section>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Tournament master states</h4>
            <p>
              The states in this section applies only to tournament masters.
            </p>
            <section>
              <h5>Initial state</h5>
              <p>
                All RPS agents start in this state, meaning they are all tournament masters.
                In this state, the agent marks the current server as the tournament server
                and then moves on to the Find state.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>Find state</h5>
              <p>
                In the Find state the agent goes through the list of agents on the same
                server. If a neighbour is in the FindWait state, the agent asks
                the neighbour to join his tournament. If the neighbour replies OK,
                or does not answer, the agent goes on asking other neighbouring agents. 
                If the neighbour instead replies that the agent should join his tournament,
                the agent goes to the PrepareJoin state.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the agent has gone through the full list of neighbours, he proceeds
                to the FindWait state.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>FindWait state</h5>
              <p>
                In the FindWait state, the agent waits for other agents to contact him with
                a join request. If the agent receives such a request, he replies either:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    OK - if the other agent's tournament has more or equally many participants.
                    In this case, the agent enters the PrepareJoin state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    JOIN - if the agent's own tournament has more participants than the other agent's tournament has.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                  When the agent has finished waiting, he continues to the FindContinue state.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>FindContinue state</h5>
              <p>
                In the FindContinue state the agent checks if he has enough participants to host a tournament.
                If so, the agent transition into the WaitForLatecomers state.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the agent does not have enough participants, he tries to choose another
                server to visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, he looks through which agents have passed by recently.
                He then follows the agent that most recently left the server
                (entering the Find state),
                as long as the footprint is not to old and that he has not met the
                other agent before.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the agent could not find anyone to follow, he asks the server
                for a list of neighbouring servers. He then choses to travel to the
                first server he has not visited before, entering the Find state.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the agent does not find any server he has not visited before,
                he decides to try to arrange the tournament anyway 
                (entering the WaitForLatecomers state).
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>WaitForLatecomers state</h5>
              <p>
                In this state, the agent waits for any last minute
                participants. Any agent asking to join during this
                time will be added as a tournament participant.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the agent has finished waiting, he enters the PrepareTournament state.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>PrepareTournament state</h5>
              <p>
                In this state, the agent first checks how many of the participants
                are still willing to participate. If there are not enough participants
                (less than two), the tournament is cancelled and the tournament participants
                are commanded to return home. In this case, the agent enters the MoveHome state.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there are enough participants to continue the tournament, the agent
                creates a match schema for all the remaining participants. This schema
                is handed out to all participants. Eventually, the agent sends the start
                message to all participants and enters the RunTournament state.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>RunTournament state</h5>
              <p>
                In this state, the agent goes through all matches acting as a judge.
                For each match, he calls out for the participants and registers the
                result of each round. The first player reaching three points win.
                If no player reaches three points in 9 rounds, the match is cancelled.
                If one player fails to take part in the match, the other part is declared
                as winner.
              </p>
              <p>
                When all games have been played through. The agent calculates a score board
                which it sends to all participants. Eventually, he enter the MoveHome state.

              <h5>PrepareJoinState</h5>
              <p>
                If the agent had participants in his previous tournament, he goes
                back to the tournament server and asks them to to join the new tournament.
                Then, the agent enter the Slave state.

              <h5>Slave state</h5>
              <p>
                  In this state, the agent patiently waits for commands from the tournament
                  master. The possible messages are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      JOIN - The tournament master has joined a bigger tournament, and instructs the agent to do so too.
                      The agent enters the JoinNewMaster state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      GO_HOME - The tournament master failed to find enough participants, and the tournament was cancelled.
                      The agent enters the MoveHome state.
                    </li>

              <p>
                The agent has been instructed to join a new master, so he waits
                at the tournament server for the tournament master to return.
                When he does, he asks the tournament master if he can join the
                tournament. If the tournament master answered OK, the agent
                enters the Slave state, otherwise he was to late and enters
                the MoveHome state.

              <p>
                In this state, the agent goes through the match schema,
                looking for his next match. If there are no more matches,
                the agent waits for statistics from the tournament master
                and then enters the MoveHome state. If there are more matches
                to play, the agent enters the Match state.

              <h5>Match state</h5>
              <p>
                In this state, the agent plays a Rock/Paper/Scissors match
                against another participant. He waits for the judge to become
                ready, then answers the judge that he is ready, and then plays
                his move as long as the judge tells him to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the match has finished, no matter if it was completed succesfully or
                not, the agent returns to the MatchPlaying state.
